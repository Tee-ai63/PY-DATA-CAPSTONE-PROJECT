World Happiness Report Analysis (2015–2024)
Overview

This project explores global and country-level happiness trends using the World Happiness Report datasets from 2015 to 2024. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand how happiness scores have changed over time, highlight key events like COVID-19, and use Kenya as a case study.

Key Features

Global Happiness Distribution: Visualize the overall distribution of happiness scores across countries.

Happiness Trends Over Time: Track changes in global happiness from 2015 to 2024 using bar and line graphs.

COVID-19 Impact: Highlight the effects of the pandemic on global happiness scores.

Kenya Case Study: Explore Kenya’s happiness trajectory, including dips during 2018 (post-election unrest), COVID years (2020–2021), and 2024 (economic and social protests).

Correlation Analysis: Examine the relationship between happiness and key factors like GDP, social support, and life expectancy.

Technologies & Libraries Used

Python 3.x

Pandas – Data manipulation

NumPy – Numerical computations

Analysis Highlights

Global Happiness Distribution – Most countries cluster around a mid-range happiness score, with outliers at both extremes.

Trend Over Time – Global happiness shows gradual improvement, with noticeable dips during COVID-19 and specific low years like 2017.

Kenya Case Study – Political unrest in 2018 and protests in 2024 contributed to temporary dips. Gradual improvement is observed thanks to economic growth and social initiatives.

Correlation Insights – Factors like GDP, social support, and life expectancy are positively correlated with happiness scores.
